Identifying associations between phenotypes and genotypes could be useful in tackling diseases/disorders. In order to do this, it is important to collect data from different sources. 
The challenge remains in how to extract, maintain and integrate such huge amount of data.

The following project deals with providing a framework that performs Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and accumulates data in the form of a knowlegde graph that could later be mined and visualized.

Techincal tools: Python, AWS Glue, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Neo4j, Cypher
